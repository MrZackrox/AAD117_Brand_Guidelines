    <p>Uncommon Knowledge. It was born out of the idea of guiding people through the adventure of becoming a freelancer. It is brought to you by Christopher Murphy who himself has made a name for himself in the freelance world and the teaching world. There's a time when he realised that you can help a lot more people reach their goals in life that just the select few that our in classes.</p>
        
    <p>With this realisation he started to build a place were budding freelancers could come and build a strong foundation for the endeavour they are setting out on. We hope to not just be apart of the bigging of the journey but rather we will be there to help guide you through out the journey.</p>

<div id="logo_mean_p">

    <p>As the word that is driving this project "adventure". We thought that the logo should some how incoreperate this into it. So we started to look at all aspects of an adventure. Until one day it just came to us. What you see now represents that jounry which you the freelancer is on. In the logo you our the sun. You have to over come the mountains that our in your way, to bring the journey you are on to new crosswroads. As all ways the sun sets and you might have an other set of mountains in your way the next day. This is why Uncommon Knowledge was created. It was created to give you the tools to soar above the mountains. </p>

    <div id="logo_p4">

    <p>This size here shoulds be the smallest the logo should go on screen. This width is 105px and this hight is 75px. It could go big for print but it depends on what its getting used for.</p>

</p>

    </div>



    <div id="logo_print_size_p3">

    <p>These bottom two would be used for bookmarks, postcards and so on. We feel that these two should be the smallest that the logo goes for. This width is 165px and this hight is 115px. This width is 105px and this hight is 75px. It could go bigger for print but it depends on what its getting used for.</p>

<div id="logo_tagp">

    <p>For the tag line and name you can only every put have it placed like in these to examples. The reason for the first one is because it signify that Uncommon Knowledge helps build a stong foundation for you journey. Then with the second option we fell that it shows how we will be there throughout your journey to guide you in any manner that you is needed. </p>

    </div>

<div id="logo_whatp">

    <p>There is not much that you can change in this logo, but there is still somethings that you can. To start you can notin under any cirumstances change were the sun is positioned. As this would look out of place and take away from the meaning of the logo.</p>
</p>

</div>

<div id="logo_whatp2">

    <p>The only time it would be premited is if you were to animate the logo with the sun rising and then it looping back to the begining.</p>
</p>

    </div>

<div id="logo_whatp3">

    <p>You then should not streach the logo in any manner to fit something. It should all ways stay in the similir dimentions. As with the sun you should not change the hight of the mountains individualy our togeather.</p>
</p>

    </div>

<div id="logo_whatp4">

    <p>Then finial do not rotate the logo to any degree as it will look odd and once again take away from the meaning behind the logo. So to end, just leave the logo the way it is.</p>

<div id= "arrow_6">
        
      <a href="#fonts"><img src="img/arrow.png" class="arrow"></a>

<div id="fonts">
    
    <h1>Fonts</h1>
                    
    </div>

<div id="font_example">        
        <img src="img/font_example.png">
    </div>

<div id="font_p">

    <p>The fonts for the website are as you can see is Oswald for the headings and Roboto Slab for the text. The reason that we went for Oswald as the headings is because it is a strong font that defines what has been writen. For the heading we feel that it should not all be in capitle letters as this is to hard to read at some times. But it can be done on occasion when it is primited.</p>
</p>

    </div>

<div id="font_p2">

    <p>For the paragraph text we have decided to go for Roboto Slab as it acents Oswald nicely. It has enough of a difference to but still complimenting it at the same time. The line spacing will be 2em throught out the site as it gives the word room to breave. This then in return. Alows the reader to take in the information easier.</p>
</p>

    </div>

<div id= "arrow_7">
        
      <a href="#colour"><img src="img/arrow.png" class="arrow"></a>

</div>


<div id="colour">
    
    <h1>Colour</h1>
                    
    </div>

<div id="colour_example">        
        <img src="img/colour.png">
    </div>

<div id="colour_p">

    <p>These three top colours are going to be the primary colour's used on the site. The reason for this is that these colours evoke more in a person when they see them used some were. An example is that blue shows trust, wisdom and so on. So we are going to us blue for customer reviews.</p>
</p>

    </div>

<div id="colour_p2">

    <p>For the second row, these colours can be used through out the site when needed. We are going to use some more than others like orange for example. We are going to use it in the price break down. Black and white are also apart of the colour selection for the site.</p>
</p>

    </div>

<div id="colour_p3">

    <p>Over all in terms of what colour is used on the site we have picked this set. Though they can be applied were its fit for them to be. We only have a few colour choices that can't be changed.</p>
</p>

    </div>

<div id= "arrow_8">
        
      <a href="#colour_2"><img src="img/arrow.png" class="arrow"></a>
</div>
    
<div id="colour_2">
    
    <h1>Colour use Ideas</h1>
                    
    </div>

<div id="colour_idea_example">        
        <img src="img/colour_idea.png">
    </div>

<div id="colour_pi">

    <p>Here are a few examples of what you could do with the colours given above. This first example is a review from a person who as all ready done the course. We went with blue as the text colour as this displays wisdom, intelligence and trust. You then have red for the colour of their name as it show passion, energy and will leave the reader having a desire to try out the course. </p>
</p>

    </div>

<div id="colour_pi2">

    <p>This here is an example of the price pipe line that will be used on the site. We picked red for the most expensive version as it will ignite the courage and passion in people who read it. Also the people who will go for this is most likely all ready has passion they just need a nudge.</p>
</p>

    </div>

<div id= "arrow_9">
        
      <a href="#icon"><img src="img/arrow.png" class="arrow"></a>
</div>

<div id="icon">
    
    <h1>Icons</h1>
                    
    </div>

<div id="icon_set">        
        <img src="img/all_icon_sets.png">
    </div>

<div id="icon_p">

    <p>This is what the icons should look like when used on the site are any were else. The top set as you can see has a bit more life to it and looks more appealing. This top set would be more apart of the graphics and promotions for the website.</p>
</p>

    </div>

<div id="icon_p2">

    <p>Here is were we get into the icons that will be used on the site. These two sets could both be used on the site. But never mix them together, it would look out of place and people might get confused. The black version of the icons would suit the website the best as they go with the colour palette better. This in return will make the icons feel apart of the site and not stand out like a soar thumb. </p>
</p>

    </div>

<div id="icon_p3">

    <p>The circle around the icons can also be taken away so that they can fit were they a positioned on the site or other content to do with the brand. It would be best for the icons to be housed in the circle on the site. The reason for this is because when you hover over them you can apply effects to show you are hovering over them.</p>
</p>

    </div>

<div id= "arrow_10">
        
      <a href="#icon_2"><img src="img/arrow.png" class="arrow"></a>
</div>

<div id="icon_2">
    
    <h1>Icons different versions</h1>
                    
    </div>

<div id="icon_set_2">        
        <img src="img/all_icons_nl.png">
    </div>

<div id="icon_p_nl">

    <p>This is just the icons with out the circles around them. This is the only other way that the icons can look interms of the sets above. The top set here looks now more fitting to be apart of graphics and promotional content for site.</p>
</p>

    </div>

<div id="icon_p2_nl">

    <p>We will most likely go for the black icons as these will suit the feel of the website the best and will work with different colours. A we said we are thinking of having this be the way the icons. Though when they are hovered over the circle might appear. To show you which one you are clicking on.</p>

    <p>Here we have the bookmarks that will be sold as in the shop a long with the other products we have to offer.  What you see here is just a guide of what the bookmarks shoulds look like when they are printed. They won't have the dotted lines on them thats just to show the boards of them for this purpose.
</p>

    </div>

<div id="merc_p_bm2">

    <p>As long as the sizing stays at 410px by 114px you can add any graphic in conjunciton with promition from Uncommon Kowledge to the bookmark. These will also be printed on to 175 gsm paper so that they will last for the customer. 
</p>

    </div>

<div id="merc_p_bm3">

    <p>What you see here is just the basics of what we can do the second one in the question mark is cut out. We can use the graphics that are going to be on the book covers here as well. You can really apply an graphic that to the book marks which is tied in with Uncommon Knowledge. Icons, logo pattern, colour scheme and what ever the future holds.

    <p>These are going to be the note pads that we give out to people that are attending the classes our as add ons for people who have bought a course.  Can you remember the note pads that you got in high school? Then some how they survived the whole year, well we do.
</p>

    </div>

<div id="merc_p_np2">

    <p>When making these we wanted them to be tough enough and durable so that your ideas can last for when they are needed. So we the paper will be 145 gsm and the cover will be 175 gsm. This will keep you ideas in better shape for longer. This is also only one of the other times that the logo will change and this is to suits the product better.</p>
</p>

    </div>

<div id="merc_p_np3">

    <p>This is just one size of the note pads that we will have on sale. There will be three other sizes and four different types of each that you can buy. There will be plain, grid, dot and line. We wanted to have variety so that the customer can choose what suites theirs needs best.

<div id="merch_page_np">

    <p>This is the four different versions of the books that you can get. We wanted to make a page that did not obstruct the user so we went for a light grey colour for the lines, to achive this. This will make the visible but not enough to take away from your work.
</p>

    </div>

<div id="merch_page_np2">

    <p>For the lined version we wanted the person using it to have room. This would allow them to write freelly with out worrying about over lapping letters. This would also be good for someone who is trying out hand lettering.
</p>

    </div>

<div id="merch_page_np3">

    <p>The squared and the dots are 1 inch squares. This insures that you can get the best detail in your sketchs. These are more for the designer who needs to get down their sketchs fast without worrying about spacing and so on.
